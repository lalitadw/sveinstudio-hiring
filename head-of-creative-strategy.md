# Head of Creative Strategy

**We’re not just looking for a creative thinker. We’re hiring a compass.**

At SVEIN, design is never an afterthought—it’s a framework for clarity, identity, and growth. We’re in search of a **Head of Creative Strategy**: someone who understands how to turn intangible vision into structured creative direction, and align aesthetics with purpose.

You’ll lead and inspire a cross-functional team of designers, CGI artists, and brand thinkers—developing creative systems that don’t just look good, but *work smart* and *speak true* to who we are.

## You might be our person if you:
- Have 5+ years in strategic creative leadership
- Can distill complex brand narratives into visuals that feel inevitable
- Think in architecture and atmosphere, not just color and layout
- Lead teams through questions, frameworks, and inspiration
- Navigate between creative vision, business context, and execution

---

## You will:
- Set the creative compass for our projects and campaigns
- Build and refine brand systems across visual, verbal, and spatial expressions
- Collaborate with leadership, marketing, and production teams
- Hold the tension between strategy and storytelling—and make both stronger
